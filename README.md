# My Notes - Powered by Quartz

This is my personal knowledge base built with [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/), a fast static-site generator designed for publishing digital gardens.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build and serve locally
npx quartz build --serve
```

Visit http://localhost:8080 to see the site.

### Build for Production

```bash
npx quartz build
```

The site will be generated in the `public/` directory.

## 📝 Adding New Notes

1. Add your Markdown files to the `content/` directory
2. Commit and push to GitHub
3. GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy the site
