## Retinal Structure & Organization

**Basic Architecture**
- Retina := Thin neural layer (~hundreds μm thick)
- 5 major cell types in 3 layers separated by 2 synaptic layers
  - Outer nuclear layer: photoreceptor cell bodies
  - Inner nuclear layer: horizontal, bipolar, amacrine cells
  - Ganglion cell layer: ganglion cells + displaced amacrine cells
  - Outer plexiform layer: photoreceptor → bipolar/horizontal synapses
  - Inner plexiform layer: bipolar → ganglion/amacrine synapses

**Special Regions**
- Fovea := Center of gaze, highest visual acuity
  - No rods, densely packed small cones
  - Foveola: other cell layers pushed aside → direct light path
  - Visual acuity limit: 1 arc minute (~1-2 cone diameters)
- Optic disc := Blind spot where axons exit
  - No photoreceptors → visual field blind spot
  - Each eye's blind spot at different location → compensation

**Information Flow**
- Photoreceptors → bipolar cells → ganglion cells (direct pathway)
- Lateral connections: horizontal cells (outer layer), amacrine cells (inner layer)
- ~100M photoreceptors → ~1M ganglion cell axons (100:1 compression)

## Photoreceptors

**Rod vs Cone Properties**
- Rods:
  - ~100M total, absent from fovea
  - Single photon sensitivity → night vision
  - Saturate at dawn light levels
  - Single type with rhodopsin
- Cones:
  - ~5M total, concentrated in fovea
  - Less sensitive → daylight vision only
  - Faster response than rods
  - 3 types: L (long-wave), M (medium-wave), S (short-wave)

**Structural Features**
- Outer segment: light transduction apparatus
  - Rods: free-floating discs separated from membrane
  - Cones: discs continuous with plasma membrane
- Inner segment: mitochondria, protein synthesis
- Cell body + synaptic terminal
- Connected by cilium

## Phototransduction Cascade

**Dark State**
- cGMP levels high → cGMP-gated channels open
- Na+/Ca2+ influx → depolarization (~-40mV)
- Continuous glutamate release from terminals

**Light Response**
1. Photon absorption: 11-cis retinal → all-trans retinal
2. Rhodopsin → metarhodopsin II (activated state)
3. Metarhodopsin II activates transducin (G-protein)
   - GDP → GTP exchange
   - Tα-GTP dissociates, activates phosphodiesterase
4. Phosphodiesterase hydrolyzes cGMP → 5'-GMP
5. ↓cGMP → channel closure → hyperpolarization
6. ↓Glutamate release

**Amplification**
- 1 rhodopsin → hundreds of transducins
- 1 phosphodiesterase → >1000 cGMP/sec hydrolyzed
- ∴ Single photon detectible

**Termination Mechanisms**
- Rhodopsin phosphorylation by rhodopsin kinase
- Arrestin binding blocks transducin interaction
- Intrinsic GTPase activity: Tα-GTP → Tα-GDP
- Ca2+ feedback (3 mechanisms):
  - Recoverin → accelerates rhodopsin phosphorylation
  - GCAP → accelerates guanylate cyclase
  - Ca2+-calmodulin → increases channel cGMP affinity

## Ganglion Cell Processing

**ON/OFF Dichotomy**
- ON cells: ↑firing to light increment
- OFF cells: ↑firing to light decrement
- Complementary representations → rapid signaling of brightening/darkening
- Origin at bipolar cell level:
  - OFF bipolars: ionotropic glutamate receptors → depolarized in dark
  - ON bipolars: metabotropic receptors → hyperpolarized in dark

**Center-Surround Organization**
- Center: direct excitation/inhibition
- Surround: opposite response via lateral inhibition
- Strongest response: center/surround contrast
- Weak response: uniform illumination
- Function: edge detection > uniform surface encoding

**Temporal Properties**
- Transient cells: brief burst at stimulus onset
- Sustained cells: maintained firing during stimulus
- Emphasis on temporal changes → prevents image fading
- Microsaccades essential to prevent adaptation

**Parallel Pathways**
- P-cells (parvocellular, ~70%):
  - Small receptive fields
  - Color opponent (L vs M, S vs L+M)
  - → LGN parvocellular layers
- M-cells (magnocellular, ~10%):
  - Large receptive fields
  - Transient responses
  - Achromatic contrast
  - → LGN magnocellular layers
- Intrinsically photosensitive (~8%):
  - Melanopsin expression
  - → Multiple targets including circadian centers

## Retinal Circuits

**Spatial Filtering**
- Horizontal cells:
  - Wide dendritic arbors + gap junctions
  - Measure average excitation over large area
  - Feedback inhibition to photoreceptors
  - Creates center-surround antagonism
- Amacrine cells (~30 types):
  - Lateral inhibition in inner retina
  - Reciprocal synapses with bipolars
  - Direct inhibition of ganglion cells
  - Enhance receptive field antagonism

**Temporal Filtering**
- Delayed inhibition circuits → transient responses
- Sudden light ↓ → cone depolarization → horizontal cell excitation → cone repolarization
- AMPA receptor desensitization → response adaptation
- Net effect: emphasize changing over static stimuli
- Compensation for slow photoreceptor response (~40ms peak)

**Color Processing**
- Trichromatic theory: 3 cone types with different spectra
- Opponent process theory realized in circuits:
  - P-cells: single cone center vs mixed surround
  - L-ON: red excitation, green inhibition
  - M-ON: green excitation, red inhibition
  - S-ON bistratified: blue excitation, yellow inhibition
- Only ~10% cortical neurons color-selective

## Color Vision Defects

**Dichromacy** (loss of one cone type)
- Protanopia: L-cone loss (~1% males)
- Deuteranopia: M-cone loss (~1% males)
- Tritanopia: S-cone loss (rare, ~0.01%)
- X-linked for red-green, chromosome 7 for blue

**Anomalous Trichromacy** (altered pigments)
- Protanomaly: L-pigment shifted
- Deuteranomaly: M-pigment shifted
- Combined ~7% males
- Hybrid L-M or M-L genes from recombination

**Genetics**
- L and M genes: tandem on X chromosome
- 96% amino acid identity → prone to recombination
- Gene deletion → dichromacy
- Hybrid genes → anomalous trichromacy

## Rod-Cone Circuit Integration

**Rod Pathway to Ganglion Cells**
- Rods → rod bipolar cells (ON only)
- Rod bipolars → AII amacrine cells
- AII amacrines diverge:
  - Gap junctions → ON cone bipolars
  - Glycinergic synapses → OFF cone bipolars
- Purpose: greater convergence for single photon detection

**Alternative Rod Pathways**
1. Rod-cone gap junctions
2. Direct rod → OFF bipolar connections
- Rod system := evolutionary addition to cone circuitry

## Adaptation Mechanisms

**Range Problem**
- Illumination varies 10^10 fold daily
- But object reflectance (behaviorally relevant) varies ~100 fold
- Visual system must extract reflectance despite illumination changes

**Adaptation Strategies**
1. **Photoreceptor adaptation**:
   - Ca2+ feedback mechanisms
   - Bleaching/regeneration balance
   - Response compression

2. **Network adaptation**:
   - Horizontal cell feedback
   - Amacrine cell circuits
   - Gain control mechanisms

3. **Perceptual consequences**:
   - Brightness constancy
   - Simultaneous contrast
   - Adaptation aftereffects

## Spatiotemporal Sensitivity

**Spatial Frequency Response**
- Band-pass behavior at photopic levels
  - Peak ~5 cycles/degree
  - High frequency cutoff ~50 cycles/degree (optical limit)
  - Low frequency attenuation (center-surround antagonism)
- Low-pass at scotopic levels (loss of surround inhibition)

**Temporal Frequency Response**
- Band-pass: peak ~10 Hz
- High frequency rolloff varies with intensity
- Flicker fusion frequency ~60 Hz (photopic)
- Critical for motion detection

## Key Processing Principles

1. **Parallel processing**: >20 ganglion cell types encode different features
2. **Data compression**: 100:1 photoreceptor:ganglion ratio
3. **Edge enhancement**: center-surround antagonism
4. **Change detection**: temporal filtering, transient responses
5. **Adaptation**: maintain function across 10^10 intensity range
6. **Convergence/divergence**: spatial pooling vs resolution tradeoff

## Clinical Relevance

**Retinal Diseases**
- Retinitis pigmentosa: progressive photoreceptor degeneration
- Stationary night blindness: phototransduction defects
- Macular degeneration: foveal damage → central vision loss

**Diagnostic Value**
- Visual field defects reveal pathway lesions
- Color vision tests detect genetic abnormalities
- ERG measures retinal function
