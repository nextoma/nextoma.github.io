# 第_25_章_注意力和动作的视觉处理 Summary

## Visual Stability During Eye Movements

**The Problem**
- Eyes make 3-4 saccades/second → retinal image constantly changes
- Brain must compensate to create stable visual world
- Challenge: distinguish self-motion from world motion
- Visual perception requires eye movements (stabilized images fade)

**Corollary Discharge Mechanism** (Helmholtz)
- Motor command copy sent to visual system
- "Efference copy" or "corollary discharge"
- Provides saccade vector (direction + amplitude) information
- Enables brain to reconstruct scene from retinal image sequence

**Receptive Field Remapping**
- Neurons respond to stimuli that will enter RF after planned saccade
- Occurs BEFORE saccade execution (~100ms prior)
- Found in: LIP, FEF, MIP, SC, V4, V3a, V2
- Explains double-step saccade task performance

**Neural Pathway**
- Superior colliculus → MD thalamus → Frontal cortex
- SC: generates saccade vectors + sends corollary discharge
- MD inactivation:
  - Disrupts RF remapping
  - Impairs double-step task
  - Shifts perceived saccade endpoint
  - Does NOT affect saccade metrics

**Saccadic Suppression**
- Visual activity suppressed during saccades
- Prevents motion blur perception
- Mechanisms:
  - Corollary discharge (weak, universal)
  - Visual masking (strong, light-dependent)
- Occurs in SC, thalamus, extrastriate cortex

## Eye Position Signals (Sherrington)

**Gain Fields**
- Parietal neurons: RF responses modulated by eye position
- Linear modulation of visual response
- Enables head-centered coordinate computation
- Source: proprioceptive signals from eye muscles

**Proprioceptive Mechanisms**
- Muscle spindles + palisade endings in eye muscles
- Area 3a: represents eye position from orbital proprioceptors
- 60ms lag behind actual eye position
- 150ms post-saccade to affect gain fields

**Complementary Systems**
- Corollary discharge: fast but less accurate
- Proprioception: slow but more accurate
- Proprioception can calibrate corollary discharge
- Brain uses both at different times

## Attention Mechanisms

**William James Definition**
- "Taking possession by the mind... of one out of several possible objects"
- Voluntary/active vs involuntary/passive attention
- Enables withdrawal from some things to deal with others

**Types of Attention**
1. **Spatial attention**: selects location in space
2. **Feature attention**: selects specific attributes (color, shape)
3. **Object-based attention**: selects entire objects

**Behavioral Effects**
- Shortened reaction times
- Improved contrast sensitivity (~50%)
- Better distractor suppression
- Enhanced object detection

**Change Blindness**
- Large visual changes missed without attention
- Demonstrates attention limits
- Even substantial differences require multiple viewings
- Attention required for conscious perception

## Parietal Cortex & Neglect

**Clinical Neglect Syndrome**
- Right parietal damage → left hemifield neglect
- Normal visual fields but impaired attention
- Cannot shift attention to contralateral space
- Extends to object-based neglect (clock drawing)

**Priority Map in LIP**
- Represents behaviorally important objects
- Not simple sensory representation
- Integrates multiple signals:
  - Saccade plans
  - Stimulus onsets
  - Cognitive relevance
  - Task demands

**Neural Response Properties**
- Stable objects: minimal response
- Abrupt onsets: strong involuntary response
- Task-relevant stable objects: enhanced response
- Response magnitude alone ≠ attention locus
- Must examine entire map to find attention peak

## Visual Processing for Action

**Dorsal Stream Specialization**
- Posterior parietal → frontal cortex
- Visual guidance of movement
- Grip aperture, wrist orientation
- Preserved in ventral stream damage

**Parietal Areas for Action**

**LIP (Lateral Intraparietal)**
- Saccade target specification
- Projects to frontal eye fields
- Priority map for eye movements

**MIP (Medial Intraparietal)**
- Reaching movement targets
- Projects to premotor reaching areas
- Encodes target location in space

**AIP (Anterior Intraparietal)**
- Object size, depth, orientation for grasping
- Shape-selective responses
- Active during viewing AND grasping
- Projects to ventral premotor (grip control)

**VIP (Ventral Intraparietal)**
- Bimodal neurons (visual + tactile)
- Near-face space representation
- Objects approaching face/mouth
- Projects to facial premotor areas

## Neural Coding Principles

**Distributed Representation**
- No single "space map" in parietal cortex
- Multiple specialized areas
- Each area tailored to specific motor system
- Parallel processing for different actions

**Reference Frame Transformations**
- Retinal coordinates → head-centered → body-centered
- Gain field modulation enables transformations
- Multiple reference frames coexist
- Task-dependent frame selection

**Sensorimotor Integration**
- Visual analysis for action requirements
- Predictive coding for movement planning
- Online correction during movement
- Feedback loops with motor areas

## Key Processing Stages

1. **Compensation**: Corollary discharge + proprioception → stable perception
2. **Selection**: Attention filters relevant information
3. **Transformation**: Retinal → spatial coordinates
4. **Specification**: Visual features → motor parameters
5. **Integration**: Multiple cues → unified action plan

## Clinical Implications

**Diagnostic Value**
- Parietal damage → specific deficits
- Neglect: attention without sensory loss
- Optic ataxia: action without perception loss
- Simultanagnosia: local without global processing

**Double Dissociations**
- Ventral damage: cannot describe but can grasp
- Dorsal damage: can describe but cannot grasp
- Demonstrates separate perception/action streams

## Outstanding Questions

- How does brain choose between corollary discharge vs proprioception?
- What determines voluntary vs involuntary attention shifts?
- How are multiple reference frames integrated?
- What role does predictive coding play in action?
