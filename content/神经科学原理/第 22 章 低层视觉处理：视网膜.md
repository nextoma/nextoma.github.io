# 第_23_章_中层视觉处理和视觉元素 Summary

## Visual Processing Levels

**Three-Level Framework**
- Low-level: Local elements (contrast, orientation) → @Chapter_22
- Mid-level: Scene integration (contours, surfaces, segmentation)
- High-level: Object recognition → @Chapter_24

**Mid-level Processing Tasks**
- Contour integration: local orientations → object boundaries
- Surface segmentation: figure vs background separation
- Surface properties: brightness/color constancy despite illumination changes
- Motion integration: local motion → global object trajectory

## Orientation Selectivity

**Simple vs Complex Cells**
- Simple cells:
  - Discrete ON/OFF subregions
  - Position-specific responses
  - Optimal: bar enters ON region, leaves OFF region
- Complex cells:
  - Overlapping ON/OFF regions
  - Position-invariant responses
  - Continuous firing as stimulus traverses receptive field

**Mechanism** (Hubel-Wiesel model)
- V1 neurons receive input from aligned LGN cells
- Center-surround RFs aligned → orientation selectivity
- Simple cells := first stage elaboration
- Complex cells := built from overlapping simple RFs

**End-Inhibition**
- Central excitatory region + flanking inhibitory regions
- Same orientation preference throughout
- Responses: short lines ✓, corners ✓, long straight lines ✗
- Function: curvature detection, corner detection

## Contour Integration

**Gestalt Principles → Neural Implementation**
- Good continuation: smooth curves > jagged contours
- Proximity: nearby elements group together
- Similarity: like elements form patterns
- Neural basis: horizontal connections between orientation columns

**Association Field**
- Notion: Spatial interactions linking contour elements
- Physiological: facilitation by elements outside classical RF
- Anatomical: long-range horizontal connections (~several mm)
- Pattern: links columns with similar orientation preference
- Function: mediates contour saliency, pop-out effects

**Illusory Contours**
- Brain constructs contours not present in stimulus
- ex: Kanizsa triangle, transparent surfaces
- Neural correlate: V1/V2 neurons respond to illusory edges
- Mechanism: interpolation based on good continuation

## Depth Processing

**Binocular Disparity**
- Fixation plane → corresponding retinal points
- Near/far objects → non-corresponding points (disparity)
- Disparity-selective neurons:
  - Tuned excitatory/inhibitory: narrow disparity range
  - Near cells: respond to crossed disparity
  - Far cells: respond to uncrossed disparity

**Global Disparity Analysis**
- Local correspondence problem → global solution required
- Disparity capture: unambiguous depth propagates to ambiguous regions
- Random-dot stereograms: pure disparity cues reveal 3D structure
- V2 neurons: sensitivity to global disparity patterns

**Monocular Depth Cues**
- Size, perspective, occlusion, brightness, motion
- Vergence: eye convergence angle
- DaVinci stereopsis: monocular occlusion zones

**Border Ownership**
- V2 neurons signal which side owns edge
- Same local contrast → different responses based on figure/ground
- Critical for scene segmentation

## Motion Processing

**Aperture Problem**
- Local motion ambiguous through small RF
- Line appears to move perpendicular to orientation
- Solution: integrate across multiple local detectors

**Direction Selectivity Mechanism**
- Sequential activation across RF
- Synaptic delays create directional preference
- Preferred direction: delays align → simultaneous input → strong response
- Null direction: temporal mismatch → weak response

**Global Motion Integration**
- MT/V5: neurons selective for pattern motion
- Plaid stimuli: components vs pattern motion
- Barber-pole illusion: segmentation cues override local motion
- Integration depends on scene segmentation

## Context-Dependent Processing

**Brightness/Color Constancy**
- Surface properties stable despite illumination changes
- Perception ≠ physical luminance/wavelength
- Context determines perceived brightness:
  - Simultaneous contrast effects
  - 3D shape assumptions (illumination from above)
- V4 neurons: color-constant responses

**Perceptual Fill-in**
- Most neurons respond to edges, not uniform surfaces
- Surface properties computed from boundary information
- Stabilized images → boundaries fade → surface fills in
- Short-term plasticity in RF properties

**Classical vs Non-Classical RF**
- Classical RF: region directly driving response
- Non-classical RF: contextual modulation from surround
- Original Kuffler (1953): RF includes all functionally connected regions
- Modern view: highly nonlinear integration

## Cortical Circuits & Plasticity

**Horizontal Connections**
- Extent: several mm parallel to cortical surface
- Specificity: link similar feature columns
- Function: integrate information across visual field
- Present in all cortical areas → general processing strategy

**Adult Plasticity**
- Retinal lesions → RF shifts to intact retina
- Mechanism: sprouting of horizontal connections
- Time course: months for reorganization
- Functional role: maintains coverage of visual field

**Perceptual Learning**
- Implicit learning through repeated discrimination
- Highly specific: no transfer between tasks/locations
- Neural correlate: V1 response changes track improvement
- ex: Vernier acuity, contour detection improve with practice
- Mechanism: modification of horizontal connection strengths

## Visual Search & Attention

**Pop-out Phenomenon**
- Simple features: immediate detection (color, orientation)
- Complex features: serial search required
- Training effect: complex → simple with practice
- Neural basis: parallel feature maps in retinotopic areas

**Attention Effects**
- Spatial attention without eye movement
- Object-based: attention spreads over attended object
- Solves binding problem through serial processing
- Change blindness demonstrates attention limits

**Top-down Influences**
- Expectation shapes perception
- Perceptual task modulates neuronal properties
- Mental imagery activates early visual areas
- Hypothesis testing: sensory input vs internal models

## Cortical Areas Specialization

**V1 (Primary Visual Cortex)**
- Orientation selectivity emerges
- Contour integration begins
- Binocular combination
- Motion direction selectivity

**V2 (Secondary Visual Cortex)**
- Border ownership
- Illusory contours
- Global disparity processing
- Surface properties

**V4**
- Color constancy
- Shape integration
- Intermediate form processing

**MT/V5 (Middle Temporal)**
- Global motion integration
- Pattern vs component motion
- Speed tuning

## Key Principles

1. **Parallel Processing**: Multiple features analyzed simultaneously
2. **Hierarchical Integration**: Local → global properties
3. **Context Dependence**: Surround modulates center responses
4. **Association Fields**: Link related features across space
5. **Plasticity**: Adult learning modifies connections
6. **Top-down Modulation**: Cognition shapes perception
7. **Scene Statistics**: Visual system exploits natural scene regularities

## Clinical/Behavioral Relevance

- Amblyopia: disrupted binocular integration
- Perceptual learning: rehabilitation potential
- Visual illusions: reveal processing mechanisms
- Change blindness: attention limitations
- Stereoblindness: depth perception deficits

## Future Directions

- Feedback vs feedforward interactions
- Intrinsic vs task-dependent processing
- Natural scene statistics optimization
- Consciousness and visual awareness
- Computational models of scene understanding
