# 第_24_章_高层视觉处理：从视觉到认知 Summary

## High-Level Visual Processing Overview

**Central Concept: Object Recognition**
- Links vision → cognition
- Objects := visual entities + associations + emotions + behavioral significance
- Recognition despite varying viewing conditions (lighting, angle, distance)
- Integration of features from earlier processing stages

**Three-Level Integration**
1. Image links: generalization across different object views
2. Category links: generalization across category members
3. Association links: connections between objects/events
- Incorporates: multimodal signals, emotional valence, semantic content

## Inferior Temporal Cortex (IT)

**Anatomical Organization**
- End stage of ventral stream: V1 → V2 → V4 → IT
- Location: lower bank of superior temporal sulcus + ventrolateral temporal convexity
- Two main subdivisions:
  - Posterior: Temporo-occipital cortex (TEO)
  - Anterior: Temporal cortex (TE)
- Large receptive fields, centrally located
- Position at hierarchy top → integrates diverse visual information

**Neural Properties**
- Complex feature selectivity (not simple features like orientation)
- Large RFs spanning visual field center
- Organized in functional columns (~400μm width)
- Horizontal connections span millimeters → distributed networks
- Response to meaningful objects (faces, hands)

**Connectivity**
- → Perirhinal/parahippocampal cortex → entorhinal cortex → hippocampus (memory)
- → Prefrontal cortex (categorization, working memory)
- → Amygdala (emotional valence)
- → Superior temporal polysensory area (multimodal integration)

## Clinical Evidence: Visual Agnosias

**Apperceptive Agnosia**
- Damage: posterior IT
- Deficit: cannot match/copy complex shapes
- Stage 1 disruption: feature integration → sensory representation

**Associative Agnosia**
- Damage: anterior IT
- Deficit: cannot identify objects (matching intact)
- Stage 2 disruption: sensory representation → meaning/function

**Category-Specific Agnosias**
- Prosopagnosia: face recognition failure
  - Can identify face as face, detect emotions
  - Cannot identify specific individuals
- Other categories: living things, tools, animals, fruits/vegetables
- Suggests specialized processing modules

## Face Processing System

**Face Patches Network**
- 6 areas in temporal lobe + 3 in prefrontal cortex (macaque)
- Fixed locations across individuals
- Named by anatomical position (PL, ML, MF, AL, AF, AM)
- Direct interconnections → specialized network

**Functional Specialization**
- Posterior → anterior gradient:
  - Posterior: view-specific responses
  - Anterior: identity-selective, view-invariant
- Dorsal areas: natural facial motion selectivity
- Ventral areas: static face processing
- >90% cells in patches are face-selective

**Human Correlates**
- Fusiform face area (FFA)
- Similar hierarchical organization
- fMRI: stronger response to faces vs other objects

## Perceptual Constancy

**Size Constancy**
- Objects perceived as same size despite retinal image changes
- IT neurons: invariant responses across size changes
- Mechanism: extraction of size-invariant features

**Position Constancy**
- Recognition independent of visual field position
- IT neurons: large RFs, position-invariant responses
- Enables translation invariance

**Form-Cue Invariance**
- Recognition despite contrast polarity/color/texture changes
- ex: Lincoln silhouette recognized in different contrasts
- IT responses invariant to these changes

**View Invariance**
- 3D object recognition from different angles
- Challenge: different views → different visible features
- Solution gradient:
  - Posterior IT: view-specific
  - Anterior IT: greater view invariance
  - Face system example: posterior view-tuned → anterior identity-tuned

**Mirror Confusion**
- Mirror images often perceived as identical
- IT neurons respond similarly to mirror images
- False positive of invariance mechanism

## Categorical Perception

**Definition**
- Better discrimination between vs within categories
- ex: red vs orange easier than two reds
- Simplifies behavior by grouping similar objects

**Neural Basis**
- Prefrontal cortex: category-selective responses
- IT cortex: feature similarity representation
- Category boundary matches learned behavioral boundary
- PFC neurons show sharp category transitions

**Functional Significance**
- Reduces computational load
- Enables generalization (all As readable despite font)
- Supports rapid decision-making

## Visual Memory Integration

### Implicit Visual Learning

**Perceptual Learning Effects**
- Improved discrimination with experience
- Neural correlates: response selectivity sharpening
- Not absolute rate changes but tuning refinement
- Creates specialized processing areas (ex: trained shapes)

**Novel Object Learning**
- Training on 3D objects from 2D views
- Post-training: neurons selective for trained views
- Face familiarity changes IT face cell tuning
- Both active discrimination and passive viewing effective

### Working Memory

**Delay-Period Activity**
- IT and PFC neurons maintain firing during delays
- IT: visual pattern/color storage
- PFC: visuospatial + multimodal information

**Differences IT vs PFC**
- IT: eliminated by intervening stimuli, sensory-focused
- PFC: task-dependent, resistant to interference
- PFC shows prospective coding (expected objects)

### Long-Term Memory

**Associative Learning**
- Paired objects → similar neural responses
- William James hypothesis: enhanced connectivity
- Neural evidence: learned pairs evoke correlated activity
- Unpaired objects: uncorrelated responses

**Memory Recall Mechanism**
- PFC prospective coding → top-down signals to IT
- Activates neurons representing expected objects
- Enables conscious recall of associations

## Specialized Processing Principles

**Distributed Representation**
- Multiple columns encode single object
- Objects activate overlapping column sets
- Horizontal connections enable binding

**Hierarchical Processing**
- V1/V2: simple features
- V4: intermediate complexity
- IT posterior: complex features
- IT anterior: whole objects, categories
- PFC: behavioral significance

**Experience-Dependent Plasticity**
- Developmental: face/shape specialization areas
- Adult: perceptual learning, new object representations
- Synaptic: enhanced connectivity for associations

## Top-Down Influences

**Expectation**
- PFC signals predicted objects
- Modulates IT responses before stimulus appears
- Facilitates recognition of expected objects

**Attention**
- Enhances responses to attended objects
- Suppresses responses to distractors
- Modulates throughout visual hierarchy

**Task Demands**
- Same neurons show different selectivity
- Context-dependent processing
- Behavioral relevance shapes responses

## Clinical Implications

**Diagnostic Value**
- Lesion location → specific deficits
- Posterior IT: perceptual integration problems
- Anterior IT: semantic/associative problems
- Category-specific regions: selective agnosias

**Rehabilitation Potential**
- Perceptual learning possible after damage
- Alternative recognition strategies
- Cross-modal compensation

## Key Principles

1. **Invariance Achievement**: Progressive abstraction from retinal image
2. **Distributed Coding**: Objects represented across multiple columns
3. **Hierarchical Organization**: Features → objects → categories
4. **Specialization**: Dedicated systems for behaviorally important categories
5. **Plasticity**: Experience shapes representations throughout life
6. **Integration**: Vision linked with memory, emotion, action systems
7. **Top-Down Modulation**: Cognition actively shapes perception
