# 第_21_章_视觉处理的构建本质 Summary

## Visual Processing as Construction

**P: Vision ≠ Camera**
- Vision := Active construction process ~> interprets scenes, parses components
- Camera → point-by-point light intensity reproduction
- Vision → object recognition despite varying conditions (lighting, occlusion)
- Evolution → visual system tuned to ecological needs

**Gestalt Principles**
- Notion: Whole > sum of parts
- Perception depends on: stimulus properties ∧ context ∧ background
- Organizational rules:
  - Similarity → grouping similar elements
  - Proximity → grouping nearby elements
  - Good continuation → linking collinear segments
  - Contour saliency → smooth contours pop out
- Figure-ground segmentation := critical for object recognition
- Higher influences → attention, expectation affect segmentation

## Visual Pathway Architecture

**Geniculostriate Pathway**
- Retina → parallel processing → ~20 local features extracted
- Features: dark/light contrast, red/green, blue/yellow
- Optic nerve → optic chiasm → partial decussation
- Temporal hemiretina → ipsilateral hemisphere
- Nasal hemiretina → contralateral hemisphere
- ∴ Each hemisphere processes contralateral visual hemifield

**Lateral Geniculate Nucleus (LGN)**
- Structure: 6 layers + koniocellular intercalated layers
  - Parvocellular (4 layers) ← midget ganglion cells (70%) → red/green info
  - Magnocellular (2 layers) ← parasol cells (10%) → achromatic contrast
  - Koniocellular ← bistratified cells (8%) → blue/yellow info
- Maintains eye-specific segregation
- Receives feedback from cortex (10:1 ratio cortex→LGN:LGN→cortex)

## Cortical Visual Areas

**Hierarchical Organization**
- V1 (Area 17) := Primary visual cortex/striate cortex
- V2 (Area 18) := Secondary visual cortex
- >30 visual areas in macaque (likely similar in humans)
- ~50% cerebral cortex involved in vision

**Two-Stream Hypothesis**
- Dorsal pathway: V1 → parietal lobe → "where" pathway
  - Function: spatial processing, visual guidance of movement
  - MT/V5 → motion direction selectivity
  - Damage → unilateral neglect
- Ventral pathway: V1 → temporal lobe → "what" pathway
  - Function: object recognition, form processing
  - IT cortex → object shape/identity storage
  - Damage → prosopagnosia (face blindness)

**Processing Levels**
1. Low-level: local contrast, orientation, color, motion
2. Mid-level: scene layout, surface properties, figure-ground
3. High-level: object recognition, semantic processing

## Receptive Fields

**Definition Evolution**
- Sherrington (1906): skin surface points eliciting reflex
- Hartline: retinal region that must be illuminated for fiber response
- Kuffler (1953): includes excitatory ∧ inhibitory regions

**Center-Surround Organization**
- ON-center cells: excitation to light in center, inhibition in surround
- OFF-center cells: opposite configuration
- Function: edge/contrast detection > uniform surface representation
- Size varies with eccentricity: fovea (0.1°) < periphery (orders of magnitude larger)

**Cortical Magnification**
- Central visual field → disproportionately large cortical area
- Fovea → highest spatial resolution → largest cortical representation
- Magnification factor decreases with eccentricity

## Columnar Organization

**Functional Columns in V1**
- Ocular dominance columns: alternating L/R eye input (~750μm cycles)
- Orientation columns: cells with similar orientation preference
  - Organization: pinwheels around singularities
  - Full 180° cycle every ~750μm
- Blobs/interblobs: color-selective vs orientation-selective
  - Cytochrome oxidase staining reveals pattern
  - Blobs → color processing, poor orientation selectivity
  - Interblobs → orientation selectivity

**Hypercolumn**
- := Complete set of orientation preferences + L/R ocular dominance
- Size: ~1mm²
- Contains all functional cell types needed for local visual analysis
- Repeated hundreds of times to tile visual field

## Intrinsic Cortical Circuits

**Laminar Processing**
- Layer 4 := primary thalamic input layer
  - 4Cα ← magnocellular LGN
  - 4Cβ ← parvocellular LGN
  - Blobs (layers 2/3) ← koniocellular LGN
- Interlaminar connections via spiny stellate cells
- Output projections:
  - Superficial layers → higher cortical areas
  - Layer 5 → superior colliculus, pons
  - Layer 6 → feedback to LGN, lower areas

**Horizontal Connections**
- Extend several mm parallel to cortical surface
- Link columns with similar orientation preference
- Enable integration across large visual field regions
- Pattern: clustered at regular intervals (~0.5mm)

**Inhibitory Control**
- Multiple interneuron classes (parvalbumin, somatostatin, VIP)
- Cascade circuits: interneuron→interneuron→excitatory cell
- Maintains stability through balanced excitation/inhibition

## Neural Coding

**Population Coding**
- Individual neurons → broad tuning curves
- Multiple neurons → weighted average representation
- Vector averaging model:
  - Each neuron := vector (direction=preference, length=response)
  - Population response := vector sum
  - Perceived value := resultant vector direction

**Labeled Line Principle**
- Each neuron signals specific stimulus value when active
- Convergence of multiple labeled lines → precise representation
- Steepest part of tuning curve := highest sensitivity

**Distributed Coding**
- No "grandmother cells" for complex objects
- Ensemble of neurons represents whole object
- Each neuron can participate in multiple ensembles
- Allows flexible, efficient representation

**Temporal Coding Hypothesis**
- Information in spike timing patterns
- Synchronous firing of neuron groups
- Potential for richer information than rate coding alone
- Role remains unclear

## Key Principles

1. **Constructive Processing**: Vision actively interprets, not passively records
2. **Parallel Processing**: Multiple features analyzed simultaneously from retina onward
3. **Hierarchical ∧ Distributed**: Processing across multiple interconnected areas
4. **Bidirectional Flow**: Dense feedback connections modulate feedforward processing
5. **Columnar Architecture**: Efficient local processing with minimal wiring
6. **Population Representation**: Percepts emerge from ensemble activity
7. **Experience-Dependent**: Neural circuits shaped by visual experience
8. **Ecological Tuning**: Visual system optimized for natural scene statistics
