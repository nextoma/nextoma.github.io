# _4_Can_we_predict_the_future_我们能预测未来吗 Summary

## Core Question: Can physical laws enable future prediction?

### Historical Evolution of Predictability

**Ancient View**:
- World = capricious (floods, plagues, earthquakes)
- Attribution to whimsical gods
- No prediction possible → Only hope: win divine favor

**Scientific Revolution**:
- Astronomy = first science (celestial regularities observed)
- Newton → Mathematical foundation for predictions
- Other phenomena → Also follow scientific laws

### Classical Determinism (Laplace)

**P: Laplace's Demon**
- Know all particles' positions & velocities at t₀
- → Calculate behavior at any t (past/future)
- Napoleon: "Where is God?" Laplace: "I don't need that hypothesis"
- **Key**: God doesn't intervene to break scientific laws

**Central Scientific Dogma**:
- Universe state at one time → Determines all other times
- Principle: Future predictable
- Practice: Limited by equation complexity + chaos

### Chaos Theory Limitation

**Butterfly Effect**:
- Small disturbance → Major changes elsewhere
- ex: Butterfly in Australia → Rain in Central Park
- **Problem**: Non-repeatable (initial conditions never identical)
- Weather prediction unreliability explained

### Quantum Revolution (20th Century)

**Planck's Discovery (1900)**:
- **Problem**: Hot objects should radiate equally at all frequencies → Universe same temperature
- **Solution**: Energy quantized in packets (quanta)
- UV/X-ray quanta > visible light quanta
- Objects need minimum energy to emit high-frequency quanta
- **Analogy**: Can't buy loose sugar, only 1kg bags

**Quantization Examples**:
- Particle spin = integer multiples of basic unit
- Discrete steps, not continuous change
- Unnoticeable at macro scale, crucial at atomic scale

### Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (1927)

**P: Fundamental Limit**
- Cannot simultaneously measure position & velocity precisely
- Measurement requires light (min 1 quantum)
- Light disturbs particle unpredictably
- Δx × Δv > h/(2m)
  - Δx = position uncertainty
  - Δv = velocity uncertainty
  - h = Planck's constant
  - m = particle mass

**Measurement Dilemma**:
- Accurate position → Short wavelength light → High energy → Large velocity disturbance
- Accurate velocity → Less disturbance needed → Poor position measurement

### Einstein vs Quantum Mechanics

**Einstein's Position**:
- "God does not play dice"
- Hidden variable theory: Underlying reality with definite positions/velocities
- Quantum uncertainty = temporary, due to measurement limitations

**Bell's Test**:
- Experimental test falsifies hidden variables
- Result: No hidden variables exist
- **Conclusion**: Even God bound by uncertainty principle
- God = compulsive gambler throwing dice constantly

### Quantum Mechanics Framework

**Wave Function (ψ)**:
- Represents particle state
- |ψ|² = probability of finding particle at position
- dψ/dx = related to velocity
- Contains all knowable information

**Trade-offs**:
- Sharp peak → Good position, poor velocity
- Spread out → Poor position, good velocity

**New Determinism**:
- Schrödinger equation: ψ(t₁) → ψ(t₂)
- Predict wave function, not position/velocity
- Only 50% of classical predictability retained

### Black Holes: Further Limitation

**New Challenge**:
- Gravity curves spacetime → Unobservable regions (black hole interiors)
- Cannot observe particles inside black holes
- Cannot measure their position/velocity
- **Question**: Does this introduce additional unpredictability?

### Evolution of Predictability

1. **Classical (Laplace)**: Complete predictability given initial conditions
2. **Quantum (Heisenberg)**: Can predict position/velocity combination only
3. **Black Holes**: Even this limited predictability threatened

### Summary Hierarchy

**Predictability Limitations**:
1. Chaos → Practical limitation (sensitivity to initial conditions)
2. Quantum mechanics → Fundamental limitation (uncertainty principle)
3. Black holes → Ultimate limitation (unobservable regions)

**Final Answer**:
- **In principle**: Yes, laws allow prediction (of wave functions)
- **In practice**: No, calculations too difficult
- Reality: Progressive loss of predictability as physics advanced

### Key Insights

- Determinism evolved from absolute → probabilistic → potentially unknowable
- Each physics revolution reduced predictability scope
- God (if exists) also constrained by physical laws
- Universe fundamentally probabilistic, not deterministic
